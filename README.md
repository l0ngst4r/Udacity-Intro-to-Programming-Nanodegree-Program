# Udacity-Intro-to-Programming-Nanodegree-Program
Session 1, Learn to Code

The session as about basic programming concepts and how the internet works. It ends with an unmarked project, which requires me to submit my first programming file containing HTML code. I have to create a notes.html page, which summarises the basic concepts the session is about, using the tags I have learning during the session and using proper HTML Document structure for the code.
